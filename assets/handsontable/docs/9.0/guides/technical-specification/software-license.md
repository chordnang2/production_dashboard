You are required to specify the license under which you use the software. This can be done by entering the corresponding keyword or a generated commercial [license key](@/guides/getting-started/license-key.md) in the `Settings` object.

## Non-commercial use

We allow you to use this software for such non-commercial purposes as, but not limited to, research, private study, and evaluation. Your use in commercial settings is strictly limited to evaluation, development and testing tier of a software deployment architecture.

**In other words, you canâ€™t enter the production stage if your project is anyhow connected with your commercial activity.**
