# Security

[[toc]]

## Overview

We take security very seriously at Handsontable. We integrate with Security Tools and Policies to provide a secure js grid. This document provides information on our Security Certification, Audits, and Policies.

## Secure data transportation

You will need to ensure that the data transportation method used both in the back-end and front-end is secure.
Handsontable is a browser-based javascript software that does not communicate with a server. We do not offer or provide recommendations for application-specific back-end solutions.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)
    
CSP is an added layer of security used to detect and diminish certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting ([XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)) and data theft.

Handsontable doesn't use external fonts, images, or scripts. Depending on whether you are hosting locally or by our recommended CDN (jsdelivr.net), you will need to use one of the following CSP rules:

The CSP Rule for Handsontable hosted locally:
```js
default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
```

The CSP Rule for Handsontable hosted by CDN  - jsdelivr.net:
```js 
default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net
``` 

## Third-party software

We use dependencies in form of third-party software, and we take a responsibility to keep them up to date and secure. We also use [Fossa](https://fossa.com), a third-party software to stay compliant with third-party license terms.

## Content sanitizing

We use [dompurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify) to sanitize the content put into data grid. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend server-side validation in addition to this to protect your data.

## High-quality code pledge

We pledge to deliver high-quality code. You can see our high-quality code score [here](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/handsontable/handsontable/context:javascript). 

Our policy is to fix issues when they arise as quickly as possible, and keep the library up to date. This requires from you, a user of this software, to keep your copy of the software up to date.

## Security certification

We hold a Security Certificate for a Security Audit carried out on November 30, 2020, of V8.2.0; by the [Securitum](https://securitum.pl/) company.

The security tests were carried out in accordance with industry-standard methodologies, including OWASP TOP10 and OWASP ASVS.

## Code auditing

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/handsontable/handsontable?targetFile=package.json) to audit our code. Snyk integrates seamlessly into development workflows, checking for vulnerabilities in our source code and any dependencies, including open source.  

Snyk provides security status notifications via email or Slack to:
 -  Monitor handsontable/handsontable:package.json in less than a minute 
 -  Find vulnerabilities using Snykâ€™s market-leading database

## Insurance

We are insured by Lloyds of London. Our policy protects Handsontable and our customers:

| Our Customers | Handsoncode (Us)  |
|--|--|
| Cyber media liability | Loss or damage to the insured's data or networks  |
| Privacy liability and loss of documents | Business interuption |
| Breach of confidentiality liability | Cyber theft|
| Cyber security liability | Cyber extortion |
| Mitigation costs | Telephone hacking of the insured's telephone lines |
| Regulatory actions and fines | Notification expenses |
| Damage to insured's reputation | Damage of the insured's reputation |

## Code escrow

**This service is available for an additional fee. [Ask our Sales](https://handsontable.com/contact?category=request_for_quotation) about the pricing.** 

Code Escrow ensures that software is maintained, protected, and not abandoned.

We host our code on GitHub, a trusted, safe platform hosted by Microsoft. In the unlikely event that something happened to our code on GitHub, a copy of our code is still protected and managed by [Codekeeper](https://codekeeper.co/), a source code escrow company.

We deposit all of our code releases automatically into CodeKeeper. In the case of a release event, Codekeeper provides quick recovery 24/7/365.

## Report a security breach

Security of our software and its application in our customers' system is our top priority. Please report any suspicious activity or evidence to [security@handsontable.com](mailto:security@handsontable.com), and we will respond promptly.
 
## Bug bounty

We don't offer a bug bounty program, but we sincerely appreciate the work done by security researchers and independent developers.
