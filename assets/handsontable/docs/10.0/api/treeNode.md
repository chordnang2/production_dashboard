## Methods

### cloneTree

Clones a tree structure deeply.

For example, for giving a tree structure:
     .--(B1)--.
  .-(C1)   .-(C2)-.----.
 (D1)     (D2)   (D3) (D4)

Cloning a tree starting from C2 node creates a mirrored tree structure.
    .-(C2)-.-----.
   (D2)   (D3) (D4)

The cloned tree can be safely modified without affecting the original structure.
After modification, the clone can be merged with a tree using the replaceTreeWith method.
